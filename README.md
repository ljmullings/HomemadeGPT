GPT Model from Scratch
This project implements a basic GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from scratch using PyTorch. The project includes training the model on dummy data and generating text using the trained model.

Usage
Files
gpt.py: Defines the GPT model architecture.
positional_encoding.py: Defines the positional encoding used in the GPT model.
transformer_decoder_layer.py: Defines the transformer decoder layer used in the GPT model.
train.py: Script to train the GPT model.
generate_text.py: Script to generate text using the trained GPT model.
dummy_data.py: Provides dummy data for training.
Training the Model
Prepare the dummy data:

Make sure you have dummy_data.py implemented to generate dummy training data.

Train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
This will train the model and save the trained model checkpoint to gpt_model.pth.

Generating Text
Generate text using the trained model:

bash
Copy code
python generate_text.py
This script will load the trained model and generate text starting from a specified start token.

Files
gpt.py
This file contains the implementation of the GPT model. It includes word embedding, positional encoding, and multiple transformer decoder layers.

positional_encoding.py
This file defines the positional encoding class used in the GPT model to provide positional information to the token embeddings.

transformer_decoder_layer.py
This file defines the transformer decoder layer used in the GPT model.

train.py
This script trains the GPT model using dummy data. It saves the model checkpoint to gpt_model.pth after training.

generate_text.py
This script generates text using the trained GPT model. It starts with a specified start token and generates a sequence of tokens.

dummy_data.py
This file generates dummy data for training the GPT model. Ensure it returns tensors for data and target.

Example Output
